    <p>
      What is MICharisma?  Imagine that there is a microphone in front of your face.  It's there because you have something beautiful to share - and many people want to hear it.  It's not a megaphone, and you're not shouting at strangers; they're coming to hear about your passion, and sometimes they're traveling and buying tickets just to see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the result of your MICharisma.  It's a way of living that is bursting with energy and passion, yet completely collected and calm.  People are drawn to your excitement, wanting to know more.  Your disarming attitude makes them feel comfortable around you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helping people feel comfortable, and making them want to listen and even learn - and even improve themselves - is hard.  My company studies this process and shares what we've learned through apps, books (iBooks), and videos.
